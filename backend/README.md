# Todolist

Backend part of Todolist project

## Getting Started

For being able to use this program, you need to replace [.env](https://github.com/MaximeDeus/Todolist/blob/master/backend/.env) file containing DB information with your own (and keep this file locally !)

Also, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/fr) is required.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Lint, compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run start
```

### Automatically fix lint errors with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint:fix
```
